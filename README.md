Gridmapper
==========

Open the [gridmapper.svg](https://campaignwiki.org/gridmapper.svg)
file using your browser and you have a very simple dungeon mapping
tool.

The user interface comes with a help screen explaining all the
details.

The project was the result of admiring Daniel R. Collins' [original
GridMapper 1.0](http://www.superdan.net/software/gridmapper/).

This originally started as a Clojure project. You can find the Clojure
code on the
[clojure](https://github.com/kensanata/gridmapper/tree/clojure)
branch.

There is also a branch called
[c2](https://github.com/kensanata/gridmapper/tree/c2) which uses
[C2](https://keminglabs.com/c2/) to create a web application.
Unfortunately, it doesn't scale well: when you use a 30Ã—30 grid, it's
too slow. I decided to move to [VanillaJS](http://vanilla-js.com/).

There's also a very good looking, Flash based website with a similar
interface called [ANAmap](http://deepnight.net/anamap/).
